         <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet Lea. She was born with the full form of Trisomy 18, known as Edwards syndrome, a chromosomal abnormality that occurs in 1 in 5,000 pregnancies. 85-90% of fetuses with this syndrome do not survive to birth, and most of those that make it through the pregnancy die in the first hours, days, or weeks after birth. Only 5 percent survive to the age of one year, but remain profoundly mentally retarded. Lea, with her life, defied this diagnosis.</p>
       <p align="center">Here we'd like to share Lea's story. A story of endless Love, Care, and Tenderness. Her entire life is a miracle and an unbelievable turn of events.</p>

        <h3 align="center"> Part 1. The Gift </h3>
        <p  align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       On October 4, 2024, I turned 40, and two weeks later, as if by surprise, I learned I was pregnant. Since having children at that age is risky, my husband, Andreas, and I decided to wait before sharing the news. Even I couldn't really process the news for the first few months. We continued working, our eldest son was finishing fifth grade, and we were preparing a performance for a language festival, planning our Christmas vacation. As time went on, thoughts of getting a genetic test kept swirling around in my head. I'm an alarmist in that regard, and with my eldest, I'd undergone all sorts of tests to make sure everything was okay. Typically, those over 35 worry about the increased risk of Down syndrome, and I was no exception. My rational side told me to get tested, but my heart was so against it, I kept postponing it, busy with work and travelling. The weeks passed, the pregnancy was easy, and I felt great: I was cycling, working, and giving talks. For Christmas and New Year's, we flew to China and then to visit family in Russia, where I got a lot of skating (!) and skiing. While in Russia, I finally decided that, even though it was late, I needed to get tested, and I went to the women's clinic. But fate had other plans: they told me they had a waiting list for six weeks, so I should come back in a couple of months. It was already January, and we had to return because I was starting my summer teaching, and my son was about to return to school. "Well, c'est la vie," I thought, "I feel great, I've never had a miscarriage or abortion before, so I guess everything is fine." Now I think it's a good thing I didn't find out about this diagnosis earlier; I can't even imagine what choice I would have made. And I wouldn't have wanted to be faced with such a difficult choice.
        </p>
         <h3 align="center"> Part 2. Puzzle</h3> 
      <p  align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       
     February passed, and I finished teaching the summer course. I already started to feel kicks, and my bump was becoming more noticeable. We decided to tell our son that he was soon going to have a little brother or sister. Contrary to our expectations, he reacted to the news with tears and cried for three days. “I don’t want anything to change, let everything stay the same,” he sobbed. This reaction was completely unexpected for me. For several weeks, we tried to convince him how wonderful it would be to have a brother or sister, but it didn’t work. Gradually, we stopped discussing the topic altogether.
At 24 weeks, I have  finally signed up for prenatal care. Of course, the first thing I heard was, “You’re 40! Why are you coming so late? Do you understand the risks?” Then came a list of questions: have you had any relatives with Down syndrome, have you had miscarriages, and so on. I was immediately placed in the high-risk category and sent for an ultrasound.
      </p>   
 <img src="images/LEA/Lea-US-26.jpg" height="250"  align="right" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px;"/>
       
     <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ultrasound session at ~26 weeks lasted 1.5 hours (!), with detailed pictures and measurements of every body part. We were delighted to learn that it was a girl, but the measurements showed she was two weeks younger than she should have been, based on her last period. It also turned out that she had something unusual in her heart, so we were scheduled for a follow-up ultrasound in three weeks, this time with a cardiologist. Meanwhile, we remained optimistic and tried to act as if it were a normal pregnancy. Although, I must say, somewhere around this time, I started obsessing over the idea of ​​signing up for nursing classes. I don't even know where it came from, to be honest. Maybe Lea somehow inspired it.</p>
 <img src="images/LEA/Lea-heart.jpg" height="300"  align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;"/>
    
 <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The follow-up ultrasound session also lasted about an hour. The results revealed a peculiarity of her heart: bilateral superior vena cava. Typically, in a fetus, two veins enter the heart, then one becomes dominant; in our case, we had two active veins. This condition affects 5% of the population, and people can live with it. They also found a ventricular septal defect, meaning there's a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart (it's moderate in size; there are small and large ones. Almost all small ones close by themselves, but large ones may require surgery).
Dr. Hutchinson, our cardiologist, invited me into a small room, sat in front of me, sketched and explained the problem (see the figure on the left). He said I should be prepared for open-heart surgery. Such surgeries are complex, and babies, especially younger than 1 year, may not survive them. I sat there, unable to believe this was happening to me. I went out, walked home, and burst into tears. </p>
 <p align="justify"> 
   The ultrasound session also revealed a small Blake's cleft cyst (a small collection of fluid in the cerebellum) in the back of the brain, so I was scheduled for an MRI on June 10th for further investigation. It revealed that the corpus callosum, the part of the brain that connects the hemispheres, was thinner than normal (this is usually associated with autism). </p> 
 
<p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 <i> < Here I'd like to take a brief digression to describe two events that seem significant in retrospect. It is the sudden passing of two incredibly kindred online friends with who we stayed connected from the LiveJournal days. On May 26th, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ekosilova">Lena Kosilova</a>,  a philosopher, Moscow State University lecturer, and a person of extraordinary depth of thought and warmth, passed away.  Living alone, immersed in philosophy, she resembled <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%8F">Hypatia</a>. She had just finished writing <a href="https://www.academia.edu/107984164/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%95_%D0%92_%D0%91%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B5">her book "Powerlessness"</a>  about the value of renouncing a domineering, power-based, attitude toward the world, about the renunciation of the will to power. She caught a cold during the May frosts, almost immediately fell ill with pneumonia, and left us within days. It seemed to us then as if her refusal to resist viruses embodied this very powerlessness. Just a week later <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidaidelman/">David Eidelman</a>, an Israeli historian, publicist, and a man of boundless erudition and talent, died suddenly. For 20 years, he lived almost on the brink of death due to heart problems. As his wife, Inna, later wrote, he had recently undergone surgery and was recovering. He really wanted to live. For the sake of Inna and Shai, his youngest son.> </i>
</p> 
 
      
<p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A week before the MRI, on June 3rd, I was invited to a meeting with geneticists. I tried to keep my cool and remain optimistic, but words can't describe the anxiety that was eating me up inside. For some reason, the only thing I was thinking about was avoiding Down syndrome. George, one of the geneticists, said, "She'll look normal, don't worry. But, you see, she has several peculiarities in different parts of her body, and this suggests that they are not independent. People can live with each of these peculiarities individually. Most likely, they have a common cause that we don't yet know about. We can piece together this puzzle by taking amniotic fluid and performing genetic testing. This could trigger premature labor. We can terminate the pregnancy. Or you can choose to deliver her and do the testing later." At that stage, I was definitely not ready to terminate the pregnancy. I felt her kicks, her hiccups (she hiccupped regularly in the evenings), we talked and were already best friends, and we were choosing her name (between Sasha, Mira, and Lea). I thought to myself, “Despite all this, her heart is beating perfectly, she’s alive! So let her live! If I had lived a few decades earlier, I wouldn’t even know anything was wrong! Except that she hiccups a little more often than usual.”
</p>      
    <p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Meanwhile, according to the ultrasound results, her growth has slowed significantly and was lagging behind. Furthermore, she wasn't turning (she was in a breech position), and we discussed whether we should try to turn her and deliver her without a C-section. After consulting with geneticists and other specialists, we decided the safest option for her was to have a planned C-section. We set a date for the very  start of the 38th week (June 18th. Incidentally, I received my PhD on this exact day in 2019!). On June 11th, my mother arrived to help us. I felt much better, since at least I didn't have to worry about our older child.
</p>  


<h3 align="center"> Part 3. Delivery </h3> 
<p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On June 18th, we arrived at the Royal Women's Hospital. While we were waiting at reception, I was booked in for a trial of an improved c-section dressing (it later turned out I was in the control group). At the appointed time, they changed my clothes, took my blood pressure, and sent me into surgery. When I entered the surgery theatre, I was asked to sit on the operating table and bend over, hugging my knees with my hands. Then they administered anesthesia, carefully laid me down, and pulled up a screen. The anesthesiologist standing on my right took my hand, and started asking about my work and my activities. At the same time, they checked how and where the anesthesia had taken effect. I gradually felt parts of my body becoming soft and warm, just like during my previous delivery with an epidural. It felt like I was becoming some kind of shapeless mass. Somewhere around the time I was explaining something about language models, AI, and where it was all going to, Andreas was called in. He came in and started holding my left hand. At one point, I felt a twitching sensation in my lower body, and… suddenly, so quickly and unexpectedly, they pulled out and showed us our little girl (the entire surgery, including stitches, takes about 25-30 minutes)! When she was shown to us, her right hand was raised and clenched into a fist. It was as if she was saying, "No Pasarán!" After seeing her, we had no doubt that she should be called Lea. It was 2:04 PM. </p>
<img src="images/LEA/Lea-just-born.jpg" height="450"  align="right" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px;"/>

[This section can be skipped; it will only be of interest to those who want to understand the general condition and first sensations after a cesarean section.]
</p>     
<p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then everyone started bustling about. Apparently, she was having trouble breathing. They put a mask on her, someone started running back and forth, and a nice young doctor who looked exactly like Kostas, a mutual friend of Andreas and me, stood to my left, legs wide apart, and commented on what was happening, in a very lively manner. But at that moment I was in a semi-conscious state and barely noticed anything. I remember my lips were very dry and I felt incredibly weak and cold. It was pleasant to feel the warmth of both hands holding me and I wanted my palms to be squeezed as tightly as possible. The surgeons stitched me up and started preparing to transport me to the ward. Lea had already been sent to the NICU, and they said she'd be fine. After the surgery, my body started trembling, as happens when you're really anxious, and it felt really, really cold. They gave me warm water to drink and put a heating pad on my chest, while they used an ice cube to check where and how the anesthesia was wearing off (sensitivity). In the ward, they wrapped me in blankets, but I was still trembling, and time seemed to drag on. A clock hang on the wall in front of me, and I watched the second hand tick by. I was comforted by the fact that Lea was okay. Andreas checked on her occasionally, he told me how beautiful and tiny she was (she was born weighing 2200g). Lying on the bed, I started trying to wiggle my big toes, just like in that famous scene in Kill Bill! Every two or three hours, they brought me strong painkillers, checked my blood pressure, changed my underwear, and my body was starting to ache more and more. Before the delivery, I read somewhere that you should try to stand up or at least sit up in the first eight to ten hours after the surgery, supposedly to have better healing, and I was mentally preparing myself to try to sit up by 11 PM. To be honest, around 7 pm, I couldn't even shift my position a little. During the night, nurses offered to let me see Lea, and I agreed. It was my first attempt at getting out of bed. They brought me a wheelchair, and with great effort and several painkillers, I managed to move into the wheelchair with the support of Andreas and a nurse. It was very painful, especially when the muscles around the wound area tightened. Around 3 am, I saw Lea for the first time since the birth. She was sleeping in the incubator, and I was sitting next to her in the wheelchair, looking at her through the small window. My heart was filled with boundless tenderness, warmth, and love.
</p>

<p align="justify">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Over the next day, I tried to overcome the pain as often as possible and get up to visit little Lea. The pain gradually reduced, and I've been given less medication. The most painful moments were those that required changing position and straining the muscles around the incision. I was especially terrified of going to the bathroom for the first few times (well, after any birth, this is almost always the most nervous moment after meeting the baby). They monitored the amount of water I drank and then the amount of urine I produced to check that my bladder was functioning properly (after birth, you don't feel the urge to go, even with a full bladder). Meanwhile, in the first few hours after birth, colostrum came in, and feeding, albeit not directly but through a feeding tube, was almost established. On the third day, when I was already able to walk back and forth between our room and Lea's, they decided to discharge me. Around that time, Lea was also taken off glucose and artificial respiration;and  she was lying with only a feeding tube only.
